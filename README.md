# Two Motor Conveyor Controller
This is a source code programmed in C for the arduino microcontroller for the logic control of two interconnected conveyor
## Description
It uses five sensors out of which 4 is the minimum requirement and the 5th sensor is fail safe  
**Warning:- Using 4 sensors will require modification of the code**  
## Position of sensors
* 1st sensor : Start point of 1st conveyor
* 2nd sensor : End point of 1st conveyor
* 3rd sensor : End point of 2nd conveyor
* 4th sensor : Mid point of buffer
* 5th sensor : End point of buffer
